<h1>How Much Ice Do I Need to Add to My Cowbow Pool?</h1>

<p>
  Ever stay at an airbnb in New Braunfels, TX with 14 of your friends in early August - and that airbnb had a Cowboy Pool that you were excited to cool off in - but that Cowboy Pool was like 85 degrees - so you wanted to figure out how many bags of ice you'd need to add to the pool in order to cool it off - so you did some drunken math on a coffee filter but wished you had a custom calculator to make the process faster?
</p>

<h1>WELL HERE IT IS!!!</h1>

<form action="/forms/calculate.php" method="post">

  <label for="fname">Volume of pool water [L]:</label><br>
